        To view something through rose-tinted glasses describes a point of view that is overly optimistic or idealistic.
        <br>

        When it comes to the LGBTQ+ community, many of us have been robbed of this opportunity. Moving through the world as a queer person can be frightening and dangerous. This is reflected in much of the media that depicts our lives. We have historically been portrayed in film, television and theatre as victims of violence and hatred - cast out by family members, trapped in unforgiving, ignorant towns and doomed relationships.

        While these narratives can certainly ring true, not every queer story is one of tragedy. We, too, can experience joy, triumph, success and love. These stories deserve to be told as well.

        Rose-Tinted Theatre seeks to view the world through a queer lens. Imagining alternate ways of existing, loving and thriving. We will tell already established stories from a new perspective and highlight the voices of those in our community who are too frequently silenced - namely, those who fall under the transgender umbrella and queer people of color.

        Our point of view is not na&iuml;vely idealistic, but it is hopeful.
